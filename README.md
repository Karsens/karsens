Probably the project I’m most proud of. Together with the 3 other founders, within one month I have successfully launched the MVP website: a booking platform for shared housing for remote workers at surf locations. The hardest part of this app was the complex logic of booking accommodation, the Stripe integration, and the optimal image delivery. Have a look at www.coworksurf.com
